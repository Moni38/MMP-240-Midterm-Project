                According to PETA, "A vegan (strict vegetarian) does not consume meat, dairy products, eggs, honey, or any product derived from an animal. A vegan diet can (and should) be full of a wide variety of delicious, nutritious foods, including vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, and fruits. Vegans don’t wear leather, fur, silk, or wool. Many refuse to use products that are made with animal ingredients, products that are filtered using animal parts (such as some wines, beers, and white sugars), and products that have been tested on animals."

                Being a vegan — or at least trying out a vegan diet — is getting mighty trendy. And as annoying as diet trends can be, in this case, that's a good thing. Because when it comes to our environment, health, and the rights of animals, adopting a vegan diet is an all-around win. Yes, eating vegan might also make you look great, and if that's the motivation for some people and celebrities who are vegan, then I say whatever diminishes the animal agriculture industry is a good thing. But while some celebrities, like Beyonce and Jay-Z, have recently adopted a part-time vegan diet, others have been at it for longer or more consistently — and have gone all the way to full-time veganism.

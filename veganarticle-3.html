        <h1>Reasons why people became Vegan</h1>
        <h2>Not just because they love there pets!</h2>
        <h4>by Monica Romero</h4>

        <p>
            The majority of vegans are ‘in it for the animals’, but you’d be surprised how many people
            first got into veganism for other reasons. Whether the initial reason is health,
            environmental ethics or to prove a point, the end result is consistent –
            people usually end up doing their research and staying vegan, for the animals.
        </p>
        <h2>Reason 1: Animals</h2>
        <p>
            Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for becoming vegan,
            but for many it remains the key factor in their decision to go vegan and stay vegan.
            Having emotional attachments with animals may form part of that reason, while many
            believe that all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. Specifics aside,
            avoiding animal products is one of the most obvious ways you can take a stand against
            animal cruelty and animal exploitation everywhere.
        </p>

        <h2>Reason 2: Health</h2>
        <p>
            Well-planned vegan diets follow healthy eating guidelines, and contain all the nutrients
            that our bodies need. Both the British Dietetic Association and the American Academy
            of Nutrition and Dietetics recognise that they are suitable for every age and stage of
            life. Some research has linked vegan diets with lower blood pressure and cholesterol,
            and lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going vegan is a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and cooking, and improve
            your diet. Getting your nutrients from plant foods allows more room in your diet for
            health-promoting options like whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables, which
            are packed full of beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals.
        </p>

        <h2>Reason 3: The Environmnet</h2>
        <p>
            From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all aware of ways to live a greener
            life. One of the most effective things an individual can do to lower their carbon footprint is
            to avoid all animal products. This goes way beyond the problem of cow flatulence!
        </p>
        <p>
            The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden on the environment -
            from crops and water required to feed the animals, to the transport and other processes involved
            from farm to fork. The vast amount of grain feed required for meat production is a significant
            contributor to deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction. In Brazil alone, the
            equivalent of 5.6 million acres of land is used to grow soya beans for animals in Europe.
            This land contributes to developing world malnutrition by driving impoverished populations
            to grow cash crops for animal feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand,
            considerably lower quantities of crops and water are required to sustain a vegan diet,
            making the switch to veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways
            to reduce our impact on the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Reason 4: The People</h2>
        <p>
            Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet,
            plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family.
            A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and
            dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental
            and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable
            way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual
            can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a
            stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affects the poorest people
            all over the world

            Being Vegan most certainly means that your diet excludes meat, eggs, dairy products and all otherm animal-derived ingredients.
            Lots of vegans don’t eat foods that are processed using animal
            products, such as refined white sugar and some wines.
            But why does Veganism get such a bad rap? To most people
            just the thought of Vegan food is cringe worthy. That is because they have yet to taste the
            great variety of vegan foods found throughout the city.

            You may be asking yourself, what exactly is it that vegans eat? Well it will surprise you
            to find out that the foods they enjoy are pretty much the same as ours with some creativity
            thrown in the mix. They eat Pancakes, Bacon, Burgers and Breads and all sorts of wonderful
            foods that you can find right here in NYC. BareBurger’s vegan offering “The Impossible Burger”
            is simply delicious. The patty itself was designed to have the same texture and consistency
            of beef. Even gets red in the middle when cooked medium-rare and is mouthwateringly juicy.
            The secret is a plant chemical called Heme, which is full of iron and causes the burger to “bleed.”
            Topped with melted cheese and all the usual fixings, the burger is enough to convince
            even a die-hard beef fanatic they’re not eating plants. Many vegan foods are now beginning
            to truly reproduce the flavors of their originators and still stay away from animal by products.
        </p>

            As people begin to realize that being a vegan does not mean giving up good food people
            can start to make better decisions as to what lifestyle they want to follow as far as a
            diet is concerned. Veganism is great for mind body and soul. It’s important to know that
            you don’t have to limit yourself in tastes and flavor. There are many places in the city
            that cater to vegans with delicious menus.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>“Jajaja” is a new downtown vegan Mexican restaurant that is well worth the wait for a table.</li>
            <li>
                “Urban Vegan Kitchen” earns a spot not only for its stellar soul food,
                but for its emphasis on intersectional veganism and community building.
            </li>
            <li>“Quintessence” is one of the oldest raw food restaurants in NYC.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These restaurants are but a few that cater to Vegans in New York and there are many more as well.
            So next time you find yourself looking at a menu in a restaurant and see the word Vegan,
            give it a shot you might like it more than you realize and give your body a break from all
            the meat this country helps you consume. Let’s begin to walk back our carbon footprint and
            start realizing that less meat won’t kill us especially when there are burgers that are
            just as good and much better for your body mind and planet.
